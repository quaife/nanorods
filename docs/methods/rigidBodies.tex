\begin{itemize}
  \item Governing equations
  \item Calculating pressure, energy dissipation, alignment angle
  \item STIV
  \item Unbounded and bounded geometries
\end{itemize}

\section{Numerical Methods\label{s:method}} 

\begin{itemize}
  \item New time integrator
  \item Near singular integration
  \item FMM
  \item STIV implementation
  \item How do we measure error so that we can do a convergence study?
\end{itemize}

\section{Results\label{s:results}} 

\begin{itemize}
  \item One of the main results is that the new time integrator can
    handle higher concentrations
  \item Two bodies in extensional
  \item Multiple bodies in extensional and/or Taylor-Green
  \item Couette with low and high concentration
