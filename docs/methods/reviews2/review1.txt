This paper deals with the numerical study of a suspension of rigid
particles in concentrated regime. A key difficulty when using a boundary
integral formulation to simulate this problem is dealing with contacts
between the rigid particles and domain boundary. Especially, the
concentrated suspension poses a formidable challenge for the simulation.
This paper contributes significantly to this issue by treating all
inter-particle interaction implicitly(globally implicit instead of
locally implicit) and augmenting the simulation with constraints that
prevent any two bodies from coming within a certain small distance from
each other. The constraint contact force is also balanced in the system.
Using this novel time stepping method, the simulation shows high
fidelity with condensed suspension. I find the approach to be
compellingly motivated, clearly presented, and well demonstrated.
Overall I find the work convincing and would be comfortable accepting it
in essentially its present form.
